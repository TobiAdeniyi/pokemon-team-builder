 The group known as E3 - the elite three - consisting of Ronac have created a VR, data-driven Pokemon team selector, which utilises a custom C compiler to reduce fetch-latency by 0.0002%. As Apprentices of Meta, THE global leader in VR and AR research and development, we attempt to emulate the game selection process of Pokemon. We implement cutting edge features such as `async` `await` to bypass unresolved promisses and use TDD and UMLs to ensure a smooth developement process.

 ## Key points
 Note: [Van](https://github.com/vtng01) did most of the work.
